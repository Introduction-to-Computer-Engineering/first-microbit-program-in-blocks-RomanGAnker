# H1 Uses of the MicroBit Project I created
 <p>The A Button is Random Number Generated and gives a "Yes", "No", "Try Again" answer almost like a Crystal Ball.
Shaking the Microbit will read the devices temperature in a string, if the temperature is higher than 21 degrees it will issue an LED illustration
The "B" Button Loops through a series of 4 different photos when it is pressed. The loop stops after it has repeated itself 4 times. </p>
